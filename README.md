## Slides and Source Code

**Nearly everything is originally from Stanford CS231n under MIT License**. Especially I didn't make most of the slide content, they are from excellent talks / papers / study notes and I carefully cite their works.

I modified all code to be PEP8 compliant and Py3k compatible. In addition, most of the practices are shorter to fit in an one-hour talk.


## Envorinment Setup

### Root Python version

Recommend to use [miniconda3] or Anaconda3 (they are same in essence). This should work on Windows, Linux, and OSX.

I target for Python 3.4+ but should be fine on Pyhton 3.3. **Never ask me how to run on Python 2.7.** ...okay, the original source runs on Python 2.7 and I simply change some library import path and classic 2vs3 difference.

> NOTE for Windows user: VS 2010 Professional+ is needed to have a 64bit C compiler. DONT use Cgywin or MinGW if you simply just googled and found them.


### (Skippable) Setup using pyenv

You can use [pyenv] to manage multiple Python versions without breaking the system-wide setting. Follow pyenv's readme to set up, which has been tested to work on Debian, Ubuntu, and OSX (but not on Windows).

```bash
# under this repo root
pyenv install miniconda3-3.8.3
pyenv local miniconda3-3.8.3
```

Now all `python` command under this repo root use miniconda's python, which can be checked by

```bash
pyenv which python
# ~/.pyenv/versions/miniconda3-3.8.3/bin/python
python
# Python 3.4.3 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, Mar  6 2015, 12:07:41)
# ...
# >>>
```

### Python virtual environment

(Mini)conda handles the virtual environment itself. It is powerful and makes everything simple for numerical computing packages.


```bash
conda create -n dnn python=3.4 \
	numpy cython            \
	matplotlib              \
	ipython-notebook
```

Activate and deactivate the envrionment is easy,

```bash
source activate dnn
deactivate
```

### Init the dataset

Go to `code/cs231n/datasets` and run the script `get_datasets.sh`.

> NOTE for Windows user: In addition, by default tools like wget and tar do not exist so `get_dataset.sh` will fail, but it can be done using pure Python through `urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, local_pth)` and `python -m tarfile -e xxxx.tar.gx`.

### Run the notebook

Go to `code` and run

```bash
source activate dnn
ipython notebook
```

A web browser will pop up on <http://localhost:8888> by default. If the code runs on a server, try bind to the correct ip address by `ipython notebook --ip="<your-ip>"` and make sure the port is permitted by the firewall.
